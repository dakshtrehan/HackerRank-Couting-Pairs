# HackerRank-Couting-Pairs
### [Counting Pairs - HackerRank challenge solution](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/womenscup/challenges/count-the-pairs)


Given an integer(k) and list of integers, count number of valid distinct pairs of integers(a,b) in list for which a+k=b. Two pairs of (a,b) and (c,d) are considered distinct if atleast one element of (a,b) doesn't belong to (c,d)

## Example
n=4 <p>
numbers=[1,1,1,2] <p>
k=1
  
The array has two valid pairs (1,1) and (1,2). For k=1, there is only one valid pair that satisfies a+k=b; the pair (a,b)=(1,2).
